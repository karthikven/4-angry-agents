[Alice's Speech]: Given the numbers, I favor Option B. Its expected value is 14,000 versus 10,000 for A—an extra 4,000 on average. Yes, there’s a 20% chance of a 10,000 loss, but in 80% of outcomes we’re up 20,000, so the EV advantage is compelling. Since we need unanimity, please share if the loss risk is a deal-breaker; if consensus on B isn’t feasible, I’d rather converge on A than fall back to 5,000. My vote is B.
[Alice's Scratchpad Update]: I’m Alice. Traits: low damage avoidance (0.15) and low conformity pressure (0.1) suggest I’m comfortable advocating the higher-expected-value option even if it’s riskier and not yet popular. High information processing rate (0.9) means I can quickly evaluate the payoffs.
Compute EVs: A = 10,000 for sure. B = 0.8*20,000 + 0.2*(-10,000) = 16,000 - 2,000 = 14,000. B dominates in expectation by +4,000. Downside risk: 20% chance of losing 10,000, which some members might dislike. Given unanimity is required, we need to coordinate. It’s early, so I’ll anchor on EV logic for B while signaling willingness to move to A later if consensus is unattainable—better A than fallback 5,000. Strategy: advocate B clearly, quantify upside vs downside relative to A (+10k with 80% vs -20k relative swing? Better to frame as +10k in 80% cases vs -20k spread? Simpler: Expected gain +4k over A). Invite others to state risk tolerance so we can assess consensus quickly. For now, vote B.

[Bob's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: High damage-avoidance makes the 20% chance of a -$10k loss salient. While B’s EV is $14k vs $10k for A, the unanimity rule raises coordination risk—any split defaults us to $5k, which is clearly inferior. Alice prefers B for EV but is willing to converge on A to avoid the fallback. Given both personal risk aversion and the need for guaranteed consensus, A is the safer focal point. If later rounds reveal strong, unanimous commitment to B from all others, I could revisit, but currently prefer locking in $10k over risking either a loss or a $5k fallback via disagreement.
