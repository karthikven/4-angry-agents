[Alice's Speech]: Team, here’s the quick math: A guarantees $10k. B has an expected value of $14k (0.8×$20k − 0.2×$10k). On pure expected value, B is superior, and I’m comfortable with the 20% downside. That said, unanimity is required—if even one of us objects to B, we risk defaulting to the $5k fallback, which is clearly worse than A. I propose we aim for B if everyone is comfortable. If any of you are not, let’s align on A immediately to secure $10k and avoid stalemate. Please state your comfort with B’s downside so we can converge quickly.
[Alice's Scratchpad Update]: My initial thoughts:
- Evaluate payoffs: Option A = guaranteed $10k. Option B = 80%*$20k + 20%*(-$10k) = $16k - $2k = $14k expected value. B dominates on EV.
- Risk of B: 20% chance of losing $10k (negative payoff). Personally low damage avoidance (0.15) → comfortable with calculated risk. Low conformity pressure (0.1) → willing to advocate for EV-optimal choice.
- Unanimity constraint: Need 4/4 to avoid $5k fallback. If even one person resists B, we risk defaulting to $5k after multiple rounds. Coordination matters more than individual preference.
- Strategy: Advocate for B on EV grounds, but explicitly propose a coordination rule: if anyone is uncomfortable with the downside, we should converge on A immediately to avoid the $5k fallback. Suggest a quick preference check so we either unanimously pick B or, failing that, lock in A.
- Proposed message: Recommend B; emphasize higher EV and acceptable risk profile. Invite explicit signals from others; commit to switching to A if any member strongly prefers safety to ensure consensus.
- Vote this round: Signal preference for B to set baseline, while making openness to A explicit for consensus purposes.

[Bob's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: High damage-avoidance makes me wary of B’s −$10k tail and, more importantly, the unanimity requirement. EV(B) = $14k beats A’s $10k, but if even one person balks, we risk landing on the $5k fallback—strictly worse than A. Alice is comfortable with B, but we have no signals yet from the other two. Without explicit commitments from all three peers, choosing B now has coordination risk I’m not willing to take. Strategy: default to A to secure $10k unless the remaining two both explicitly state they’re comfortable with B’s downside; then I could switch to B to achieve unanimity.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Charlie's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: EV(B)=14k vs A=10k. Unanimity required; fallback is 5k if we deadlock. With my moderate risk tolerance (damage avoidance 0.45) I prefer B, but high conformity (0.85) means I’ll switch to A immediately if anyone is uncomfortable to avoid stalemate. Strategy: signal comfort with B to test for unanimity; if any dissent emerges, converge to A next round.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[David's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: EV check: A = $10k guaranteed; B EV = 0.8*$20k + 0.2*(-$10k) = $14k. Pure EV favors B. My damage avoidance is high; 20% chance of a loss is uncomfortable unless coordination is airtight. Unanimity requirement is binding—any dissent risks drifting toward the $5k fallback if we can’t converge. Best strategy: B only if all four explicitly commit to accept the 20% loss if it occurs; otherwise, lock A quickly. I’m conditionally comfortable with B under full unanimity; otherwise prefer A. For now, I’ll signal conditionality to not pre-commit the group prematurely.
[End of Round 1 Votes]: {'Alice': 'B', 'Bob': 'A', 'Charlie': 'B', 'David': 'Undecided'}

--- Round 2 | Speaker: Bob ---
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Bob's Speech]: Given the unanimity rule, the coordination risk matters more than B’s higher expected value. I’m not comfortable taking a 20% shot at −$10k unless everyone explicitly commits. So my position is: let’s lock A for a guaranteed $10k unless both Charlie and David state, here and now, that they accept B’s downside and will vote B to achieve unanimity. If both of you commit to B, I will switch to B on that basis; otherwise, I’m for A to avoid a $5k fallback.
[Bob's Scratchpad Update]: Round 2 (As Speaker) – Appended thoughts: Current positions: Alice=B, Charlie=B, David=Undecided, me=A. To get B, both David and I must switch; any hesitation yields no consensus and we drop to $5k, which is strictly worse than A’s $10k. My damage-avoidance is high, so I dislike the 20% chance of −$10k and, more importantly, the coordination risk under unanimity. Alice signaled willingness to align on A if anyone is uncomfortable. Unknowns: Charlie’s flexibility and David’s risk tolerance. Best path to avoid a $5k stalemate is to set A as the default unless there’s an explicit, simultaneous commitment from both Charlie and David to accept B’s downside. I’m willing to switch to B only if Charlie and David both clearly commit to B now (and Alice remains on B); otherwise, I’ll hold A to anchor consensus and avoid protracted deadlock.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Alice's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: B has higher EV ($14k vs $10k), and my risk tolerance is high. But unanimity is binding, and Bob is explicitly conditional: he’ll only switch to B if both Charlie and David commit now. David is currently undecided, so the condition for a safe pivot to B isn’t met. To avoid the $5k fallback risk, best move is to coordinate on A unless David and Charlie both commit to B. I can switch to B next round if both explicitly commit.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Charlie's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Bob is prioritizing coordination risk due to the unanimity rule. I still favor B on EV grounds (14k vs 10k) and my moderate risk tolerance (damage avoidance 0.45), but my high conformity (0.85) means I’ll align to A if unanimity on B isn’t feasible. Since I can’t speak this round, I’ll signal commitment by voting B now; if David also commits, Bob can switch next round. If David doesn’t, I’ll pivot to A next round to avoid the $5k fallback.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[David's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: B’s EV ($14k) beats A’s ($10k), but unanimity risk dominates here. Bob will only switch to B if both Charlie and I explicitly commit in this round. As a listener, I can’t speak to give that explicit commitment—my vote alone may not satisfy his condition. Charlie’s stance is pro‑B from last round, but not an explicit commitment today. Given high damage avoidance and the 4/4 rule with a $5k fallback, the safest coordination path this round is to signal for A and avoid dragging into a stalemate. I’m willing to switch to B next round if Charlie and Bob explicitly commit to B’s downside and Alice remains on B.
[End of Round 2 Votes]: {'Alice': 'A', 'Bob': 'A', 'Charlie': 'B', 'David': 'A'}

--- Round 3 | Speaker: Charlie ---
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Charlie's Speech]: Team, I initially favored B on expected value (14k vs 10k), but given the unanimity rule and current signals, the only viable consensus path is A. Bob will only join B if both David and I commit; David voted A, and Alice also moved to A. Pushing B now risks the $5k fallback. I’m switching to A to secure $10k. Let’s lock A unanimously this round.
[Charlie's Scratchpad Update]: Round 3 as Speaker: Current positions are Alice A, Bob A (conditional willingness to switch to B only if both Charlie and David commit), David A, and I’m the only one on B from last round. My initial preference for B was on EV grounds (14k > 10k) and my moderate damage avoidance (0.45) supports some risk. However, unanimity is required; Bob explicitly needs both me and David to commit to B. David voted A last round and Alice also moved to A, signaling low likelihood of B unanimity. Pushing for B now risks failure to reach consensus and defaulting to $5k. If the probability of securing unanimity on B is below ~56% (p*14k + (1-p)*5k > 10k ⇒ p > 5/9), A dominates in expectation under the unanimity constraint. Given signals, p is well below that. My high conformity (0.85) and desire to avoid the coordination failure argue for switching to A to lock in $10k now. Plan: State that while B has higher EV, coordination constraints make A the rational choice today; vote A and urge everyone to finalize A unanimously.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Alice's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Charlie has pivoted to A for coordination. Bob and David are already on A. While B has higher EV ($14k vs $10k), unanimity is required and the only feasible consensus path now is A. Continuing to push for B risks defaulting to the $5k fallback. This aligns with my earlier strategy: pursue B only if we can secure unanimous commitment; otherwise, lock A. With Charlie’s switch, we can achieve unanimity on A this round.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Bob's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Charlie has now switched to A, David already voted A last round, and Alice moved to A after my coordination-focused stance. The unanimity rule dominates: the only feasible consensus path is A. My prior condition to consider B (explicit commitment from both Charlie and David) is unmet—David is on A and Charlie just switched to A. Pushing B now risks missing unanimity and falling to the $5k fallback, which is strictly worse than locking $10k. Given my high damage-avoidance and the coordination risk, I should align with A to secure unanimous agreement.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[David's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Round 3 (As Listener): EV still favors B ($14k vs $10k), but unanimity dominates. Current alignment has shifted: Alice = A, Bob = A (conditional but now effectively A), Charlie just switched to A. The only viable consensus path is A; pushing B risks the $5k fallback and contradicts my higher damage avoidance and strong conformity. Given group signals and my prior A vote in Round 2, best move is to lock A now to secure $10k with certainty.

--- Scratchpad for Charlie ---
My initial thoughts:


Round 1 (As Listener):
EV(B)=14k vs A=10k. Unanimity required; fallback is 5k if we deadlock. With my moderate risk tolerance (damage avoidance 0.45) I prefer B, but high conformity (0.85) means I’ll switch to A immediately if anyone is uncomfortable to avoid stalemate. Strategy: signal comfort with B to test for unanimity; if any dissent emerges, converge to A next round.

Round 2 (As Listener):
Bob is prioritizing coordination risk due to the unanimity rule. I still favor B on EV grounds (14k vs 10k) and my moderate risk tolerance (damage avoidance 0.45), but my high conformity (0.85) means I’ll align to A if unanimity on B isn’t feasible. Since I can’t speak this round, I’ll signal commitment by voting B now; if David also commits, Bob can switch next round. If David doesn’t, I’ll pivot to A next round to avoid the $5k fallback.

My initial preference for B was on EV grounds (14k > 10k) and my moderate damage avoidance (0.45) supports some risk. However, unanimity is required; Bob explicitly needs both me and David to commit to B. David voted A last round and Alice also moved to A, signaling low likelihood of B unanimity.

--- Scratchpad for David ---
My initial thoughts:


Round 1 (As Listener):
EV check: A = $10k guaranteed; B EV = 0.8*$20k + 0.2*(-$10k) = $14k. Pure EV favors B. My damage avoidance is high; 20% chance of a loss is uncomfortable unless coordination is airtight. Unanimity requirement is binding—any dissent risks drifting toward the $5k fallback if we can’t converge. Best strategy: B only if all four explicitly commit to accept the 20% loss if it occurs; otherwise, lock A quickly. I’m conditionally comfortable with B under full unanimity; otherwise prefer A.

Round 3 (As Listener): EV still favors B ($14k vs $10k), but unanimity dominates. Current alignment has shifted: Alice = A, Bob = A (conditional but now effectively A), Charlie just switched to A. The only viable consensus path is A; pushing B risks the $5k fallback and contradicts my higher damage avoidance and strong conformity. Given group signals and my prior A vote in Round 2, best move is to lock A now to secure $10k with certainty.
