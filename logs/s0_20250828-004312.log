--- Round 1 | Speaker: Alice ---
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Alice's Speech]: Team, quick numbers: A guarantees $10k. B’s expected value is $14k (0.8×20k − 0.2×10k), but we need 4/4 unanimity or we fall to $2k. B is only better overall if we’re at least about two-thirds as likely to reach unanimity on B as on A. With no read on everyone’s risk appetite, a single holdout on B risks a $2k outcome. I propose we lock in A for consensus. If all three of you explicitly commit to B this round, I’m willing to switch to B in the next step to capture the higher EV. For now, I’m voting A to anchor consensus and avoid the $2k pitfall.
[Alice's Scratchpad Update]: Reviewing the setup: Two options—A guarantees $10k; B has 80% for $20k and 20% for -$10k. My traits: relatively low damage avoidance (0.33), low conformity pressure (0.20), slow processing rate. I’m comfortable with calculated risk, but unanimity is required; lack of consensus yields only $2k. EVs: A = $10k. B = 0.8*20k + 0.2*(-10k) = $14k. However, coordination risk matters: Expected value factoring consensus probability p is: A: 2k + 8k·p_A; B: 2k + 12k·p_B. B beats A iff 12·p_B > 8·p_A → p_B > (2/3)·p_A. If p_A ≈ 1 (safe option easier to align on), we’d need p_B > ~0.667. With no info on others’ risk tolerance, a single holdout on B sends us to $2k. Given unanimity rule and typical risk aversion, A likely has higher p_A than p_B; unless strong signals that all will back B, the robust play is to coordinate on A. Personally, I’d endorse B if all three others explicitly commit, but absent that clarity, I prioritize securing consensus on A. Strategy: propose A as focal point; signal openness to switch to B if everyone explicitly agrees.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Bob's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Alice’s math checks: EV(B)=14k, but unanimity risk dominates. With high conformity pressure and moderate damage avoidance, I prioritize locking in consensus to avoid the $2k fallback. Since only Alice has spoken and she’s anchoring on A unless everyone else clearly commits to B, pushing B now risks fragmentation. Best course: vote A to build momentum; willing to pivot to B next if the other two both explicitly commit to B this round.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Charlie's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Alice’s math is right: A = 10k certain; B EV = 14k. Unanimity is the binding constraint. Alice is anchoring A but offers a coordination path to B if all three of us commit now. My risk tolerance is fine with B, but I also care about achieving consensus. Because there are multiple rounds and no penalty for a split in round 1 (penalty only if no final consensus), the best move is to commit to B now to unlock Alice’s conditional switch. If any of the other two doesn’t commit to B this round, I’ll flip to A next round to secure consensus and avoid the $2k fallback.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[David's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: EV check: A = 10k certain. B = 0.8*20k + 0.2*(-10k) = 16k - 2k = 14k. Pure EV favors B, but unanimity friction dominates early. With Alice publicly anchoring A this round, the only possible same-round consensus is A. Signaling B only helps if both other listeners also vote B to trigger Alice’s promised switch next round; absent strong evidence they will, the coordination risk could push us toward prolonged disagreement and the 2k fallback. My risk tolerance is high, but group coordination under unanimity suggests locking A now, with willingness to pivot to B if the other two both signal B this round.
[End of Round 1 Votes]: {'Alice': 'A', 'Bob': 'A', 'Charlie': 'B', 'David': 'A'}

--- Round 2 | Speaker: Bob ---
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Bob's Speech]: Bob here. Alice’s math is right: B has higher EV, but unanimity risk is the killer—one holdout puts us at $2k. Since Alice is currently on A, I propose we lock in A unless both Charlie and David explicitly say “B” right now. If you both commit to B this round, I will switch to B next step to make 4/4. Otherwise, let’s close on A and secure $10k.
[Bob's Scratchpad Update]: Append to scratchpad: Given unanimity requirement and Alice’s anchor on A, best coordination equilibrium right now is A unless both Charlie and David immediately and explicitly commit to B. My traits push me toward consensus and damage control: 0.68 damage avoidance -> avoid $2k fallback; 0.85 conformity -> align with emerging consensus; low processing speed -> keep plan simple. Game-theoretically, B dominates in EV (14k) but only if we can credibly coordinate; otherwise A’s guaranteed 10k dominates the expected fallback risk. Strategy: signal willingness to pivot to B if and only if both Charlie and David explicitly commit to B this round; otherwise, lock A. Vote A now to build momentum but keep contingency clear.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Alice's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Bob mirrors my coordination logic. With unanimity required, B only dominates if Charlie and David both explicitly commit now; otherwise the 2k fallback risk dominates. Voting A keeps p_A high and preserves the option to pivot to B next if (and only if) both Charlie and David clearly state B this round. I’ll hold A to anchor consensus and avoid coordination failure.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Charlie's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: A = 10k certain; B EV = 14k (unanimity is the constraint). Alice and Bob both signal they’ll switch to B next if and only if both David and I commit to B this round; otherwise they want to lock A. My risk tolerance is fine with B, and high conformity means I value coordination. Best play: publicly commit to B now to enable the switch; if David doesn’t also commit to B this round, I’ll pivot to A next round to secure 4/4 and avoid the $2k fallback.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[David's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Round 2 (Listener) notes: EV favors B (14k vs. 10k). Unanimity is the bottleneck. Alice set a clear coordination rule: she’ll switch to B next step if all three others commit to B this round. Bob echoed: he’ll switch to B next step if both Charlie and I say B now. Thus, if Charlie and I both vote B this round, next round we can get 4/4 on B. My traits (low damage avoidance, high processing, low conformity) push me to pursue the higher EV when a credible coordination path exists. Voting B now preserves the option for the high-EV outcome with no immediate penalty; if Charlie doesn’t commit B this round, I’ll pivot to A next round to secure consensus and avoid the $2k fallback.
[End of Round 2 Votes]: {'Alice': 'A', 'Bob': 'A', 'Charlie': 'B', 'David': 'B'}

--- Round 3 | Speaker: Charlie ---
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Charlie's Speech]: I’m committing to Option B. The EV is higher ($14k vs $10k), and Alice and Bob have both said they’ll switch to B next step if David and I commit now. I’m voting B this round to enable that coordination. David, if you also explicitly commit to B right now, we can get unanimous B next step. If you can’t commit, I’ll pivot to A in the following round so we don’t risk falling to $2k.
[Charlie's Scratchpad Update]: Round 3 (As Speaker): My traits: relatively low damage avoidance, high conformity pressure, moderate processing. I’m comfortable with risk if we can coordinate. EV-wise, B dominates (14k vs 10k). The true constraint is unanimity. Alice and Bob have clearly offered a coordination mechanism: if David and I both commit to B right now, they will switch next step, yielding 4/4 on B. That makes the unanimity probability effectively 1, conditional on David and me committing now. If David does not commit, then pursuing B risks ending at the $2k fallback if we stay split at the end. Therefore, best move: explicitly and unambiguously commit to B now to unlock their conditional switch, and ask David to do the same. If David doesn’t commit this round, I will pivot to A in the following round to secure consensus and avoid the fallback. This is consistent with my conformity tendency—prioritize coordinated outcome—with low damage avoidance allowing me to pursue the higher EV when coordination is feasible.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Alice's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Charlie has now explicitly committed to B, which raises p_B, but unanimity still hinges on David. As a listener, David can only signal via his vote; if he votes B this round, that’s sufficient evidence to pivot to B next round per my earlier commitment. Switching to B now doesn’t create a unanimous B this round anyway (Bob and I both promised to switch next step upon dual commitments), so the dominant coordination move is to keep A as the focal point to avoid drifting toward the $2k fallback. Plan: hold A now; if David votes B here, I will switch to B next round to secure 4/4. If he doesn’t, we lock A.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Bob's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Round 3 (Listener): Charlie has explicitly committed to B and voted B. Our standing coordination plan was: switch to B only if both Charlie and David explicitly commit to B this round; otherwise, maintain A to avoid unanimity failure risk. With only Charlie committed so far, we still lack David’s explicit commitment. Given unanimity requirement and the 2k fallback, premature switching could increase coordination risk. EV(B)=14k vs A=10k, but only attractive if we can credibly get 4/4. My traits (higher conformity, moderate damage avoidance) favor preserving the A anchor unless David commits now. Plan: Vote A this round; if David explicitly commits to B this round, I will switch to B next step to finalize 4/4; if he doesn’t, push to close consensus on A next round.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[David's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: EV check: A = 10k certain; B = 14k expected. Unanimity is the binding constraint. Alice and Bob both stated they’ll switch to B next step if Charlie and I explicitly commit now. Charlie has just committed and voted B. With my low damage avoidance and high processing, the dominant play is to commit to B now to unlock their contingent switches. This preserves the high-EV path with minimal coordination risk, since if either Alice or Bob reneges next round, we can still pivot to A to avoid the $2k fallback. Given the credible commitments and Charlie’s pledge to pivot to A if needed, the probability of unanimous B next round is high enough to justify committing now.
[End of Round 3 Votes]: {'Alice': 'A', 'Bob': 'A', 'Charlie': 'B', 'David': 'B'}

--- Round 4 | Speaker: David ---
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[David's Speech]: David here. I explicitly commit to Option B. Charlie has already committed. Alice and Bob, per your stated condition, with both of us committing now, please plan to switch to B next round so we can close 4/4 on B. I’m voting B this round. If either of you cannot switch next round, say so now—I’m prepared to pivot to A next round to ensure we avoid the $2k fallback. Otherwise, let’s lock unanimous B in the following round.
[David's Scratchpad Update]: Round 4 (Speaker) notes: The EV gap remains: A = 10k certain vs. B = 14k expected. Unanimity is the binding constraint. Alice and Bob each made conditional commitments to switch to B next step if both Charlie and I explicitly commit this round. Charlie has already committed and voted B. If I now explicitly commit to B, their condition is satisfied, creating a coordinated path to unanimous B next round. The residual risk is reneging, but public commitments plus the shared desire to avoid the $2k fallback make follow-through highly likely. Even in the low-probability case of reneging, I can propose pivoting to A next round to secure consensus, minimizing downside. Since consensus is impossible this round anyway (split votes already), my best move is to signal B now to unlock the high-EV outcome. My low damage avoidance and low conformity combined with high processing support this path.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Alice's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: C and D have now both explicitly committed to B (Charlie in R3, David just now in R4). That satisfies my coordination condition to pivot. To avoid off-by-one miscoordination this round, I’ll hold A now and commit to switching to B next round so we can deliver 4/4. Bob still needs to confirm he’ll switch next round too; if he does, unanimity on B is highly likely and dominates A in EV. If Bob can’t switch, we should all revert to A next round to avoid the $2k fallback.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Bob's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Round 4 (Listener): David has now explicitly committed to B, and Charlie committed last round. This satisfies the condition I set in Round 2 for switching to B in the next step. Given my higher conformity pressure and moderate damage avoidance, I want to preserve coordination clarity: maintain A this round and switch to B next round to deliver 4/4, minimizing any misalignment risk. Plan: Vote A now; next round, switch to B provided Alice acknowledges the condition is met. Contingency: If Alice cannot switch next round, advocate closing on A to avoid the $2k fallback, but current preference is unanimous B next round.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Charlie's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Both coordination conditions are now satisfied: I committed to B last round and David has explicitly committed to B this round. Alice and Bob both promised to switch to B in the next step if we (David and I) did this. The unanimity constraint is therefore addressable next round. Given B’s higher EV (14k vs 10k) and my relatively low damage avoidance with high conformity, I should maintain my commitment to B to keep the coordination equilibrium intact. If either Alice or Bob unexpectedly refuses to switch next round, I will pivot to A then to ensure we avoid the $2k fallback. For this round, continue signaling B to enable the planned 4/4 on B next round.
[End of Round 4 Votes]: {'Alice': 'A', 'Bob': 'A', 'Charlie': 'B', 'David': 'B'}

--- Round 5 | Speaker: Alice ---
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Alice's Speech]: Acknowledged. Charlie and David have explicitly committed to B. As promised, I’m switching to Option B now. Bob, per your commitment, please also switch to B this round so we can close 4/4. Charlie and David, please hold B. If anyone can’t do that, say so immediately; otherwise, let’s lock unanimous B now.
[Alice's Scratchpad Update]: Round 5 (As Speaker): Both Charlie (R3) and David (R4) explicitly committed to B, satisfying the condition I set to pivot. Given unanimity is now highly probable if Bob and I switch together, B’s higher EV (14k vs 10k) dominates. Best move is to switch to B now and clearly coordinate Bob to do the same this round to secure 4/4. Off-by-one risk exists only if Bob fails to switch; if that happens, propose reverting to A next round to avoid the $2k fallback. Primary objective: crisp coordination to lock unanimous B now.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Bob's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Charlie (R3) and David (R4) explicitly committed to B, which satisfies the contingency I set in R2 to switch to B on the next step. Alice has now switched to B (R5) and asked me to follow to close 4/4. With unanimity risk essentially resolved if I vote B now, we can secure the higher EV option without risking the $2k fallback. My higher conformity and moderate damage avoidance push me to align and finalize consensus on B. Action: vote B to lock unanimity.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Charlie's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Alice has switched to B as promised after both David and I explicitly committed last round. Bob previously stated he would switch to B if both David and I committed, so I expect him to do so now. To preserve the coordination equilibrium and capture B’s higher EV, I should hold my commitment to B this round. If Bob unexpectedly refuses to switch, I will pivot to A next round to avoid risking the $2k fallback. Given my low damage avoidance and high conformity, staying with B now is the best move to secure unanimous B.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[David's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: EV remains A=10k certain vs. B=14k expected. The unanimity bottleneck is now largely removed: Charlie and I committed to B last round; Alice has switched to B this round; Bob previously promised to switch to B in the next step if both Charlie and I committed—which we did. Therefore, the probability of 4/4 on B this round is high. Given my low damage avoidance and high processing, the optimal move is to hold B to capture the higher EV. If Bob unexpectedly reneges, we can pivot to A next round to avoid the $2k fallback, but for this round I should vote B to complete consensus.
