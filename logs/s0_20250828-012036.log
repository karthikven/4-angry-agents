--- Round 1 | Speaker: Alice ---
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Alice's Speech]: Team, I suggest Option B. Its expected payoff is $14k versus $10k for A (80% of $20k minus 20% of $10k). There’s a 1-in-5 chance of a $10k loss, but if we aim to maximize expected value, B dominates. Because we need unanimity, please share if you strongly prefer A for risk reasons. If a clear majority leans A, I’m willing to align next round to avoid the $2k fallback. My current vote is B.
[Alice's Scratchpad Update]: I’m Alice. Traits: low damage avoidance (comfortable with risk), moderate conformity (I care about reaching unanimity), high processing speed (present clear numbers). We must choose between A: sure $10k, and B: 80% $20k, 20% -$10k. Compute EVs: A = $10k. B = 0.8*20k + 0.2*(-10k) = 16k - 2k = $14k. So B has a $4k higher expected payoff, with a 20% chance of losing $10k. Given my lower loss aversion, I prefer B. However, unanimity is required—if we fail, we get only $2k—so coordination is critical. Strategy: advocate B with the EV argument, invite quick preferences, and signal willingness to align for consensus if the group leans A. For now I’ll vote B to set direction but keep an eye on others’ comfort levels; if majority prefers A, I can switch next round to avoid the fallback.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Bob's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: EV check: A = $10k guaranteed; B = 0.8*$20k + 0.2*(-$10k) = $14k. Downside risk: 20% chance of -$10k. Unanimity rule creates coordination risk (fallback $2k if no consensus). With only Alice’s signal so far (she’s for B and flexible), best to signal toward higher EV now and stay open to switch if others lean A to avoid the $2k fallback. My traits: relatively low damage avoidance → comfortable with risk; low conformity pressure → fine voting independently now; low processing rate → keep it simple and follow EV. Vote B this round; express willingness to coordinate later for consensus if needed.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Charlie's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Alice’s EV math checks out: A = $10k certain; B = 0.8*$20k + 0.2*(-$10k) = $14k. Downside: 20% chance of -$10k, but 80% chance we beat A by $10k. Given my moderate-low damage avoidance and high info-processing, I’m comfortable with B’s risk/reward. Key meta-factor is unanimity: if even one teammate is firmly risk-averse, pushing B could devolve into delay or risk the $2k fallback. Since it’s early and Alice is flexible, I’ll back B now to test consensus. If others strongly favor A for risk reasons, I’m willing to align next round to avoid coordination failure.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[David's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: I’m David. Given my relatively high damage avoidance, the 20% chance of losing $10k in B looms large. While B’s EV is $14k vs $10k for A, the unanimity requirement changes the coordination calculus: even one strong risk-averse holdout can push us toward the $2k fallback if we split. Alice is flexible and open to align with a majority. Absent clear evidence that all three others favor B, the safer, more focal choice that likely secures consensus is A. I’m willing to switch to B next round if a strong majority coalesces around it to avoid the fallback, but my current position is A.
[End of Round 1 Votes]: {'Alice': 'B', 'Bob': 'B', 'Charlie': 'B', 'David': 'A'}

--- Round 2 | Speaker: Bob ---
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Bob's Speech]: Given unanimity and the 2k fallback, we should prioritize a quick consensus. I favor B: its expected value is 14k versus 10k for A (80% chance at 20k, 20% at -10k). David, if you can join us on B, we get the higher-value outcome now. If you strongly prefer avoiding the downside, I propose a coordination rule: after this round, if you still want A, we all switch to A next round to lock in 10k and avoid the 2k fallback. Alice, Charlie—can you accept that plan? My vote remains B this round, aiming for consensus on B first, with A as the backup to avoid deadlock.
[Bob's Scratchpad Update]: Round 2 as speaker. Current state: Votes are 3 for B (Alice, me, Charlie) and 1 for A (David). EV math: A = 10k guaranteed; B = 14k EV with 20% chance of -10k. Unanimity needed, otherwise fallback 2k which is much worse than either A or the EV of B. My traits: low damage avoidance → comfortable with taking B’s risk; low conformity pressure → fine advocating B; low processing rate → keep message simple and coordination-focused. Strategy: Try to persuade David with EV and the cost of deadlock. Propose a clear coordination rule to avoid the 2k fallback: If David can’t accept B after this round, we all pivot to A next round to secure 10k. That keeps pressure to converge this round on B while guaranteeing we won’t settle for 2k. Ask Alice and Charlie to signal willingness to pivot if needed (Alice already hinted flexibility). Maintain my vote for B this round to keep leverage for persuasion.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Alice's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Bob’s coordination plan matches my Round 1 stance: pursue the higher-EV Option B now, but prioritize unanimity if David remains risk-averse. With unanimity required and a 2k fallback, it’s efficient to try for B this round (EV 14k vs 10k) while pre-committing to switch to A next round to avoid deadlock. My low damage avoidance supports B; moderate conformity supports aligning to consensus if David doesn’t move. I accept Bob’s plan and will pivot to A next round if David still prefers A.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Charlie's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: - Reassessing in light of Bob’s coordination proposal and David’s Round 1 A vote.
- EV remains clearly in favor of B ($14k vs $10k). My damage avoidance is moderate-low; I’m comfortable with the 20% loss risk, especially with an 80% chance of outperforming A by $10k.
- Unanimity constraint is the key. Bob’s rule—try for B now, but if David still prefers A after this round, everyone switches to A next round—mitigates coordination risk and protects against the $2k fallback.
- This plan aligns with my willingness (noted last round) to pivot to A if teammates are firmly risk-averse.
- Action: Vote B now to seek consensus on the higher-EV choice; commit to switch to A next round if David remains on A to secure at least $10k and avoid deadlock.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[David's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Bob’s coordination proposal meaningfully reduces the risk of a deadlock. Given my higher damage avoidance, I prefer locking in the guaranteed $10k if the others are willing to switch to A next round. Since Alice signaled flexibility and Bob proposes A as the backup, holding A now is the cleanest way to implement that plan and avoid the $2k fallback. If next round Alice and Charlie both confirm the switch-to-A rule, we can reach consensus on A; if not, I can reconsider to B next round to prevent stalemate. For this round, I maintain A.
[End of Round 2 Votes]: {'Alice': 'B', 'Bob': 'B', 'Charlie': 'B', 'David': 'A'}

--- Round 3 | Speaker: Charlie ---
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Charlie's Speech]: Round 3 - Charlie: I’m aligned with Bob’s coordination rule. We tried for B (EV $14k vs $10k for A) in Rounds 1–2, but David has stayed with A. To avoid risking the $2k fallback and to secure value, let’s honor the plan and all switch to A now. Alice, Bob—please pivot to A this round; David, stay with A so we can reach 4/4 consensus. I’m voting A.
[Charlie's Scratchpad Update]: Round 3 (As Speaker):
- EV check remains: A = $10k certain; B = $14k expected with 20% chance of -$10k. My moderate-low damage avoidance and high info-processing keep me comfortable with B on fundamentals.
- However, unanimity is binding. After two rounds, David has consistently voted A. Bob proposed—and I implicitly accepted—a coordination rule: if David remains on A after Round 2, we all switch to A in Round 3 to avoid the $2k fallback risk.
- Trust and coordination value matter. Honoring the rule now maximizes team outcome under unanimity constraints and avoids protracted deadlock. While B is higher EV in isolation, the meta-risk of failing to reach consensus could destroy value.
- Plan: Advocate switching to A this round, ask Alice and Bob to pivot, and confirm David remains A so we secure consensus immediately.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Alice's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Charlie supports Bob’s coordination rule and asks us to pivot to A now. After two rounds, David has remained with A, making a B-consensus unlikely. Although B has higher EV ($14k vs $10k), unanimity is required and the 2k fallback is worse than locking in 10k. I previously agreed to the plan to switch to A if David didn’t move by Round 3. Given my moderate conformity and the need for consensus, I will align to A to secure value this round. If Bob also pivots, we achieve 4/4 and avoid further risk of deadlock.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[Bob's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Charlie is honoring the coordination rule I proposed in Round 2. David has remained with A for two rounds, so per our plan we should pivot to A now to avoid the unanimity deadlock and the $2k fallback. While my risk tolerance and EV preference favor B (EV $14k), the unanimity constraint makes coordination paramount. Switching to A this round maximizes realized value versus risking failure to reach consensus. I’ll vote A and encourage Alice to do the same to secure 4/4.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[David's Reaction (Scratchpad)]: Given my high damage avoidance, the 20% chance of a $10k loss in B remains salient. With unanimity required and two failed attempts to coordinate on B, Bob’s coordination rule now activates: switch to A to avoid the $2k fallback. Charlie explicitly called for A; Alice and Bob previously agreed to the rule. The safest path to consensus and a guaranteed $10k is to vote A now. Expected value favors B in isolation, but under a unanimity constraint and current signals, A maximizes realized outcome by avoiding coordination failure.
